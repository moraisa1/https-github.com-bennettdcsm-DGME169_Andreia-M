 <h1>About Unique Cookies</h1>
 <p class="about-intro">
 Unique Cookies was born in my family kitchen in Brazil 34 years ago. A seven year
 old girl baking with her grandmother's 70 years old mixer and a dream to share her
 delicious cookies with the world.

 <!-- OUR STORY with childhood mixer video -->
 <section class="about-row about-row-reverse">
 <div class="about-text">
 <h2>Our story</h2>
 <p>
 What started as a simple way to raise money at church became a lifelong love for
 desserts, hospitality and making people feel cared for.
 </p>
 <p>
 Years later that same love, faith and passion became Unique Cookies, a company
 built on God, excellence and connection. Every box is a little piece of that
 story, sent from my kitchen to your home.

 <!-- WHY OUR COOKIES ARE DIFFERENT with caramel cookie photo -->
 <section class="about-row">
 <div class="about-text">
 <h2>Why our cookies are different</h2>
 <p>
 We use coconut oil, noisette, ghee and luxury chocolate to create a rich,
 indulgent experience that feels like it came from a luxury bakery, without all
 the work in your kitchen.
 </p>
 <p>
 Our cookies are already baked for you. Store them in the freezer for up to
 3 months, warm them for a few seconds and enjoy gourmet cookies anytime you crave.
