DGME 169 Phase 1 Website Project

Student: Andréia Morais

Hi Professor Bennet,

I uploaded my full website project here on GitHub, including all HTML, CSS, logos, and images.
The only file not included is the about-video.mp4, because GitHub does not allow files over 25MB.

To make sure you receive everything,
I also submitted the complete project on Canvas.

Thank you so much.
